# React + Vite + MockAPI

## all songs src taken from  https://lesfm.net

# Description
This project is my first attempt to create a web application in ReactJS. It is a simple audio player that allows to play music from an external data source (mockAPI). The player supports basic functions like play, pause, skip tracks, select previous or next track, random play and auto repeat tracks. The user can see the current time of the song being played and the time remaining. The app also displays information about the currently playing song, including title, artist and track length, and allows users to browse the playlist.
# What I learned:
ReactJS Basics: Working with components, state (useState), and effect hooks (useEffect).
Data management: Fetching data from an external API using fetch and then processing and displaying it in the application.
Manipulating HTML audio element: managing the playback of songs using the HTML audio API.
Event handling: managing user interactions such as play button clicks, pauses, track skipping and random playback.
CSS and styling: The basics of styling components and creating a responsive user interface.
This project allowed me to get my first hands-on experience with ReactJS and understand how components can work together to create a dynamic and interactive web application.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
